I have added a new topic, why is it shown with disabled tab in the menu?
==========================================================================

The topic will only be enabled if it has all the keys present, and has at least one subtopic. Similarly, for a subtopic to be enabled, it must have all its keys present. To avoid unexpected errors in the application, always fill the data completely.
