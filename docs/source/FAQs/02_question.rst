How to add a new topic?
=========================

.. include:: ../style.rst

To add a new topic, open :blue:`topics.json` and add a new topic in the existing list, along with complete information including its title, heading, subtopics etc(refer to one of the topics that already exists). The topic must have one or more subtopics. The first subtopic in the list of subtopics is considered as default. Hence, once a topic tab on the main menu is clicked, the information relevant to this first/default subtopic will be loaded at various parts of the website.
