UI Framework
==============

The template uses Vuetify 2.6, which is a UI framework based on Material Design. The main areas utilising Vuetify styles include,  menu generation and grid system to create responsive design . There are a number of custom built stylesheets present as well at the moment, which can be replaced with Vuetify styles to create a more uniform system.
