Frontend Frameworks
====================

The Template is developed using Vue 2.6 and Nuxt 2.15. At the time the development started, the latest version of Vue i.e Vue 3 was not considered as production ready and is not supported by the version of Vuetify used in this application(see UI Framework section below). The Nuxt is a framework based on Vue, that makes development of Vue projects easier by providing development features like server side rendering and automatically generating routes; and is very handy for static site generation.
